set

#1. Convert words present in a list into uppercase and store them in a set.

# Sample list of words
words_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]

# Convert words to uppercase and store in a set
words_set = {word.upper() for word in words_list}

print("Set of words in uppercase:", words_set)

#2. Create a set containing 10 random numbers in the range 15 to 45, count how many are less than 30, and delete all numbers greater than 35.

import random

# Create a set of 10 random numbers in the range 15 to 45
random_numbers = {random.randint(15, 45) for _ in range(10)}
print("Original set of random numbers:", random_numbers)

# Count how many numbers are less than 30
less_than_30 = len([num for num in random_numbers if num < 30])
print(f"Count of numbers less than 30: {less_than_30}")

# Delete all numbers greater than 35
random_numbers = {num for num in random_numbers if num <= 35}
print("Set after deleting numbers greater than 35:", random_numbers)

#3. Create an empty set, add five new names to this set, modify one existing name, and delete two names from it.

# Create an empty set
names_set = set()

# Add five new names to the set
names_set.add("Alice")
names_set.add("Bob")
names_set.add("Charlie")
names_set.add("David")
names_set.add("Eve")
print("Set after adding names:", names_set)

# Modify an existing name (since sets are unordered, we will remove and add the modified name)
names_set.remove("Bob")
names_set.add("Bobby")
print("Set after modifying 'Bob' to 'Bobby':", names_set)

# Delete two names from the set
names_set.remove("Alice")
names_set.remove("Charlie")
print("Set after deleting 'Alice' and 'Charlie':", names_set)

#4. Separate names that begin with 'A' and 'B' into two different sets.

# Set of names
names_set = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Anna", "Brian", "Bella"}

# Separate the names into two sets: one for names starting with 'A' and one for names starting with 'B'
a_names = {name for name in names_set if name.startswith('A')}
b_names = {name for name in names_set if name.startswith('B')}

print("Names that start with 'A':", a_names)
print("Names that start with 'B':", b_names)
